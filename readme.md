## This is a clone of Mike(mpech)'s PicoLisp (https://git.envs.net/mpech/pil21.git) which he's being actively working on .

Minimal modifications made to src/Makefile to get it compiling on Macos x86_64 Intel(monteray).

If you have trouble rebuilding (missing symbols to the linker), do a make clean and restore files ht.ll, base.ll and ext.ll in ./src from the repo. 

Have fun.
